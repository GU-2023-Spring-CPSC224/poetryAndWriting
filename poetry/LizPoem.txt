Two funny oranges in a fruit bowl,
Cracking jokes and having a ball,
One said to the other with a grin,
"You make my pulp churn within."

The other blushed a shade of red,
And shyly looked down instead,
But then mustered up the courage to say,
"I feel the same in every way."

And so they rolled closer and closer,
Their love for each other growing bolder,
Together they laughed and danced and played,
In their sweet citrus love, they happily stayed.
