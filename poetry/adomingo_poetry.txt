Dogs are creatures of love and light,
With tails that wag and hearts so bright.
Their fur is soft and their eyes so kind,
They're always there, a true friend to find.

Their paws are quick and their noses keen,
They sniff out joy in every scene.
They play and run with boundless glee,
And share their happiness so generously.

From the smallest pup to the largest hound,
They fill our world with barks and sounds.
Their loyalty and devotion are true,
Their love for us forever new.

They cuddle close when we're feeling down,
And always lift us up when we're feeling drowned.
Their unconditional love is a gift so rare,
A bond that nothing can ever compare.

Dogs are more than just a pet,
They're a companion that we won't forget.
So let's cherish them with all our heart,
And love them back right from the start.
