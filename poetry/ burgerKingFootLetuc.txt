Number 15, Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd
want in your burger king burger is someone's foot fungus.
But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer
uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet
in a plastic bin of lettuce with the statement: "this is the
lettuce you eat at burger king" admittedly, he had shoes on,
but that's even worse. The post went live at 11:38 pm on july
16th. And a mere 20 minutes later, the burger king in question
was alerted to the rouge employee. At least, I hope he's rouge.
How did it happen? well, the BK employee had it removed the exif
data from the uploaded photo which suggested the culprit was
somewhere in Mayfield Heights Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three
minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted
with wishes of happy unemployment. Five minutes later the news
station was contacted by another 4chaner and three minutes later
at 11:58, a link was posted. BK's "tell us about us" online form,
the foot photo, otherwise known as Exhibit A was attached.
Cleveland scene magazine contacted the BK in question. The next
day, when questioned, the breakfast shift manager said: "Oh I
know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery solved by 4chan.
Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.
