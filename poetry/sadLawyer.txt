The lawyer stood in his office, feeling low,
As he looked out the window at the falling snow,
He had sent a panda to jail, years ago,
And now the guilt was starting to grow.

The case had seemed simple at first,
The panda accused of theft, the evidence cursed,
But now he saw things in a different light,
And couldn't help but feel that he had not been right.

He remembered the trial, the arguments made,
The panda's protests, his pleas to evade,
But the lawyer had been convinced of his guilt,
And now, years later, he couldn't shake the guilt.

The panda had been taken away,
To a life of confinement, day after day,
And though the lawyer had moved on,
The panda's fate still weighed upon him, long gone.

He wondered if he could make things right,
To somehow bring the panda back into the light,
And set him free from his unjust fate,
But he knew it was too late.

So he sat in his office, alone with his thoughts,
Wondering what good all his legal work had brought,
And he vowed to be more careful in the future,
To never again let his judgment falter.

For though the panda was now a memory,
His fate a reminder of the lawyer's misdeed,
The lesson learned, forever to be heeded,
To always strive for justice, never to be defeated.
