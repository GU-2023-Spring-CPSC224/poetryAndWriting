Bill Clinton, former President of the States,
A man of power, but also of debates,
His time in office, often controversial,
But on a motorbike, he's almost pastoral.

With leather jacket and helmet on his head,
He revs his engine, ready to be led,
On a journey through the winding roads,
Of the countryside, where freedom flows.

The wind in his hair, the sun on his face,
He feels alive, a sense of grace,
The weight of the world, lifted for a while,
As he rides his bike, mile after mile.

For a moment, he's not a politician,
But a man on a mission,
To explore the land, and feel the breeze,
To escape the stress, and find some peace.

And though his time in office may be debated,
His love of biking, cannot be overstated,
For in that passion, we see a different side,
Of a man who once held the nation's guide.
