There once was a man from Peru,
Who dreamed of becoming a kangaroo,
He hopped around with glee,
And ate leaves from a tree,
But his neighbors just thought he was cuckoo.

There once was a cat named Jim,
Who loved to play the violin,
But every time he tried,
The sounds were quite fried,
And the mice just laughed at him with a grin.

There once was a dog named Lou,
Who loved to chew on his shoe,
But when he looked away,
A squirrel stole it away,
And Lou was left feeling quite blue.

There once was a bird named Fred,
Who had feathers all over his head,
He tried to comb them down,
But they just bounced around,
And he looked like he had just left his bed.
