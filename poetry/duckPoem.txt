A duck glides through the water,
With feathers sleek and bright,
Its webbed feet paddle smoothly,
As it takes off in flight.

A quack echoes through the pond,
As the duck explores its space,
Searching for food and shelter,
In this peaceful, tranquil place.

It dives down deep below,
To find a tasty snack,
And then pops back up again,
With a joyful little quack.

The duck is one with nature,
In harmony with its surroundings,
A symbol of simplicity,
And the beauty it is bounding.

So let us stop and watch,
This wondrous feathered friend,
And appreciate the world we share,
With creatures great and small, till the end.
