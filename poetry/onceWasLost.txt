Once was lost, adrift in the night
No compass, no stars, no guiding light
The darkness seemed endless, the silence profound
No sight or sound, no comfort found

But then a flicker, a glimmer of hope
A distant beacon on a far-off slope
A path through the gloom, a way to go
A destination, a purpose to know

With faltering steps, I stumbled on
Through wind and rain, until the dawn
And there it was, my journey's end
A new beginning, a chance to mend

For in the depths of the darkest hour
We often find our greatest power
And though we may stumble, stuff.
