In Dr. Bowersâ€™ class, a quiz I failed,
It was a terrible day for rain and so it hailed,

Luckily there's a quiz drop in that class,
Otherwise to the next life I would have to pass, (in game)

Now I don't know if I should be worried,
Because on the last quiz I was hurried,

For everyone else's answer their methods numbered at five,
I'm just hoping my two method answer will thrive...
