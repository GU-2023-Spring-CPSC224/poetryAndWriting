Oh Coca-Cola, sweet and brown,
Your taste once brought such joy.
But now you bring a bitter frown,
And memories to destroy.

I used to love your fizzy pop,
Your sugary delight.
But now I taste the bitter drop,
Of memories I can't fight.

For every time I taste your drink,
I'm reminded of the past.
Of loved ones lost, of tears and ink,
And how those times didn't last.

You were the drink of happier days,
Of moments spent with friends.
But now you're just a bittersweet haze,
That brings my heart to bend.

Oh Coca-Cola, how I miss,
The way you used to be.
But now your taste just brings the hiss,
Of a heart that's filled with debris.
