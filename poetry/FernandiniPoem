Oh, Java, tongue of code, so sweetly sung,
A language born to run upon the screen,
With functions, classes, loops, and lists among,
A realm of possibility unseen.

In worlds of bytes and bits, you are the light,
A tool that shapes our digital domain,
The power of the code within our sight,
As we create, debug, and then maintain.

With every line, we weave a tapestry,
Of code that holds a vision and a dream,
A world of ones and zeros that we see,
Through eyes that parse and execute each scheme.

Oh, Java, how you guide us on our way,
To code the future, one line at a time, we say.
