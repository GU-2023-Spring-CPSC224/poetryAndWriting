Oh Coca-Cola, how you haunt me so,
With memories of a love that used to flow.
Your sweet, carbonated kiss,
Once brought me such sweet bliss.

But now your taste is bitter-sweet,
A reminder of a love incomplete.
The memories flood back with each sip,
Of a heart that was shattered and split.

I used to hold the bottle close,
And feel the warmth of a love so close.
But now I'm left with an empty ache,
As I watch the bubbles fade and break.

Oh Coca-Cola, how you mock me,
With every sip that I take so bitterly.
A reminder of what I have lost,
Of a love that was too great a cost.

Your sweetness is now my curse,
A reminder of what could have been worse.
Of a love that has long since passed,
Leaving me with memories that will last.

Oh Coca-Cola, how you make me weep,
With every memory that I try to keep.
Your sweet taste now brings only pain,
Of a love that will never be whole again.
