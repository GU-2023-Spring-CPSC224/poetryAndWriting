Once upon a time, in a peaceful meadow by a river, there lived a group of geese. They would spend their days honking, swimming, and munching on the green grass.

One day, while the geese were out foraging for food, a gust of wind blew a branch from a nearby tree, hitting one of the geese named Gus right on the head. Gus tumbled to the ground and lay there motionless.

The other geese rushed over to help, and they quickly realized that something was wrong with Gus. They tried to wake him up, but he remained unconscious.

The geese were worried and didn't know what to do, so they decided to seek help from a nearby farmer. The farmer was kind and agreed to take a look at Gus. Upon examination, he discovered that Gus had a concussion.

The farmer suggested that Gus be kept in a quiet, dark place to rest and recover. He also advised the geese to keep a watchful eye on Gus and to make sure he ate and drank enough water.

The geese took the farmer's advice seriously and took turns keeping watch over Gus. They made sure he had plenty of water and food, and they even took turns napping next to him to keep him company.

As the days passed, Gus slowly began to show signs of improvement. He would occasionally wake up and eat a little bit, and he even managed to honk softly a few times.

Finally, after several days of rest, Gus was able to stand up and walk around again. The other geese were overjoyed to see their friend back on his feet.

From then on, the geese made sure to be extra careful and watch out for each other. They knew that accidents could happen, but they also knew that they could count on each other to be there in times of need.
