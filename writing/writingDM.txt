Delainey Maxwell - writing:

"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." - Socrates.

This statement highlights the importance of humility and the pursuit of knowledge.
It suggests that acknowledging our own limitations and the vastness of what we don't know
is the first step towards true understanding and wisdom. It also implies that learning
 is a continuous process and that no one can ever know everything.
