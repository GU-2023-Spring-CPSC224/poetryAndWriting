Sencha refers to the largest category of Japanese green teas. At its core, sencha is tea leaves that have been harvested, steamed and then undergo a series of drying, rolling, and 
shaping steps. Categorically, sencha is made in almost every area of production in Japan from as far north as Saitama prefecture to as south as the southern island of Tanegashima. 
Sencha encompasses a world of stylistic differences and flavor profiles with each region focused on a different point of importance. The sheer volume of sencha produced in Japan 
means you can discover endless variations much like red wine in France.
