It's not uncommon to see some students with questionable fashion choices in 
computer science classes. From outdated graphic tees to ill-fitting cargo 
pants, the lack of attention to personal style can be jarring. While comfort 
is important, there's no reason to sacrifice style entirely. Dressing well 
can help boost confidence and create a positive image for oneself. Additionally, 
computer science is a field where first impressions can be critical in job 
interviews and networking events. While clothing shouldn't be the only factor 
in these situations, it can certainly play a role in making a good impression. 
Overall, it's important to strike a balance between comfort and style when it comes 
to dressing for computer science classes.
