Rizz, oh Rizz, what can we say?
So much about you, we could relay.
You're unique, you're one of a kind,
A person like you is hard to find.

Your energy is boundless, your spirit high,
With you around, time just flies by.
Your laughter is contagious, your smile wide,
And when you're near, we feel alive.

You bring people together, you bridge the gaps,
You make us forget about our mishaps.
You're always there to lend an ear,
To listen and help, to calm our fear.

Rizz, you brighten up our days,
In so many countless ways.
We're lucky to have you in our life,
A true gem, a friend, a light.
